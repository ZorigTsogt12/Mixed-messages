## Introduction
As a programmer who is starting to learn *full-stack web development*, it is often difficult to stay focused. Therefore, I have compiled a simple program to print a random inspirational quote to keep you and I motivated.
The full list of quotes can be found at [this link](https://www.oberlo.co.uk/blog/motivational-quotes). 

An example quote would be:

>We are what we repeatedly do.
>Excellence, then, is not an act,
>but a habit
>-- Aristotle

## Technologies

1. Javascript
2. Node.js v14.17.6

## Future changes

I hope to build a local website using HTML and CSS. The website will print the quote and include an image of the author in the background with detailed CSS styling. 

I also hope to use Python web scraping tools to create a list of quotes from the website.

Thank you for reading and happy coding.
